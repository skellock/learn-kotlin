# hello

A simple and self-contained command line app. I followed the [kotlinlang.org tutorial](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/command-line.html) for the command line.

Can be compiled with `kotlinc` and `kotlinc-native`.

There's also an example of compiling without the Kotlin runtime and using `kotlin`. Not sure you'd ever do this, but you can. Building without the runtime seems more like a way to build libraries.
